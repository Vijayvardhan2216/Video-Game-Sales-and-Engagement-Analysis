        "  - **Quality :** After preprocessing, duplicate records were removed and inconsistencies in column names, formats, and categorical values were standardized, resulting in a clean and structured dataset suitable for analysis.\n",
        "  - **Missing Data :** Minor missing values were observed in certain fields (such as ratings, publisher, or year). These were handled using appropriate imputation techniques or labeled as “Unknown,” ensuring reliability and completeness for further analysis.\n",
        "  - **Feature Composition :** The dataset contains both numerical variables (ratings, plays, wishlist counts, regional sales, global sales) and categorical variables (genre, platform, publisher, developer, region).\n",
        "  - **Key Risk Drivers :** User ratings, wishlist counts, genre and platform type emerged as the most influential factors affecting global sales performance.\n",
        "  - **Sales Patterns :** Global sales are highly concentrated among specific genres and platforms. Games with higher engagement metrics tend to show stronger commercial performance.\n",
        "  - **Regional Variation :** North America and Europe contribute the highest share of global sales, while Japan exhibits distinct genre preferences, indicating the importance of region-specific strategies.\n",
        "  - **Analytical Focus :** The analysis focuses on identifying the key drivers of video game sales, understanding engagement-to-sales relationships and supporting data-driven marketing, development and sales forecasting decisions.\n"
