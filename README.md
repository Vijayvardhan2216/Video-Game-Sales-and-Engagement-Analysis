# Video-Game-Sales-and-Engagement-Analysis
An in-depth analysis of video game sales and user engagement data to identify key factors influencing game performance and commercial success.

**Project Overview :-** This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of video game sales and user engagement data. The primary goal is to identify the key factors that significantly influence game performance and commercial success, enabling data-driven decisions for game development, marketing strategies, platform prioritization and sales forecasting.

**Objective:** To analyze video game sales and user engagement data to identify key factors influencing game performance and commercial success. The analysis aims to support data-driven decisions for game development, marketing strategies, platform prioritization and sales forecasting, ultimately leading to optimized resource allocation and increased profitability.

**Key Findings:** The analysis of the video game sales and engagement dataset revealed strong correlations between user engagement metrics and global sales. The project identified critical drivers of success and highlighted regional preferences. Key insights include:

| Factor | Primary Issue | Root Cause | Impact on Sales | Model Metric |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Wishlist Count** | High Demand Indicator | Pre-release interest | **Strong positive correlation** with Global Sales. | Strong Predictor |
| **Plays** | User Engagement | Post-release activity | **Positive correlation** with Global Sales. | Strong Predictor |
| **User Rating** | Perceived Quality | Player satisfaction | **Moderate positive correlation** with Global Sales. | Moderate Predictor |
| **Genre-Platform Combinations** | Market Dominance | Strategic alignment | Certain combinations consistently **outperform others** in sales. | High Impact |
| **Regional Sales (NA, EU)** | Revenue Contribution | Market size & preference | North America and Europe contribute the **highest share** of global sales. | High Impact |

**Actionable Recommendations :-**

Based on the insights derived, the following targeted interventions are recommended to maximize sales and optimize strategic decisions:

**1. Focus on High-Performing Genre–Platform Combinations**

- **Targeted Development:** Prioritize game development and marketing efforts on genre–platform combinations identified as commercially successful through data analysis.

**2. Leverage Engagement Metrics for Forecasting**

- **Early Demand Prediction:** Utilize wishlist counts, ratings and plays as early indicators to forecast demand before launch, enabling more accurate sales predictions.

**3. Implement Region-Specific Marketing Strategies**

- **Localized Campaigns:** Tailor marketing campaigns to specific regions, prioritizing North America and Europe while considering localized approaches for markets like Japan.

**4. Maintain a Balanced Portfolio Strategy**

- **Risk Mitigation:** Combine blockbuster-potential titles with stable, consistent-performing genres to mitigate risk and ensure sustained revenue.

**5. Continuous Performance Monitoring**

- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Implement interactive dashboards (e.g., Power BI) for real-time monitoring of game performance, facilitating agile, data-driven decision-making.

**Methodology and Tools :-**

The analysis followed a structured Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) approach, integrating data from two sources.

**1. Data Wrangling:** Merging two datasets (Game Engagement Data and Sales Data) on game title, standardizing column names and handling duplicates/missing values.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducting univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis to understand data distributions, variable relationships and the impact of engagement metrics, genres, platforms and regions on sales.

**3. Visualization:** Creating various charts (scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps, pair plots) to visualize relationships and trends.

**Tools Used:**

- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For data processing, analysis and visualization logic.
- **SQL:** For structured database creation, table normalization and data merging.
- **Power BI:** For interactive dashboard development and visual storytelling.

**Conclusion :-** This project demonstrates how data analytics and visualization can transform raw gaming data into actionable business intelligence, enabling strategic growth and competitive advantage in the dynamic gaming market. By leveraging these insights, gaming companies can make data-driven decisions in product development, marketing strategy, platform selection and regional expansion, supporting improved sales forecasting, optimized resource allocation, risk management and long-term profitability.
